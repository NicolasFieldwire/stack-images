Building Stack Images Locally
=============================

To build the stack images locally, run this from the repo root:

    ./docker-build.sh STACK
  
The supported stacks are:

* `cedar-14`
* `heroku-16` (will also build a `heroku-16-build` image)
* `heroku-18` (will also build a `heroku-18-build` image)
